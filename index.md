### CPSC 120

* Lab 6 Part 1

    This lab was my favorite lab because, although it was simple it taught me how to use const without overwhleming me. Like some other labs we would learn how to apply a skill however it would sometimes overwhlem me. However in lab 6 part 1 we only used const 3 times. Which made it easier for me to understand how to apply const and use it for other labs for the future. Also this was my favorite lab because not only did it help me learn how to use const it kept me hooked because I loved playing madlibs as a child and it was an easy subject which was Sandwhich orders
